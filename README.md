# StarWars-Survey

In this project, we are addressing the question regarding the Star Wars series - does the rest of America realize that “The Empire Strikes Back” is clearly the best of the bunch?

To achieve this, we are going to analyse the data collected by FiveThirtyEight after surveying Star Wars fans using the online tool SurveyMonkey. They received 835 total responses.
